[Live Demo: Todo-Scape](https://todo-scape.vercel.app)

## Project Overview

**Todo-Scape** is a beautifully designed and simple-to-use task management application built with **React** and integrated with **Redux** for state management. The app allows users to add, remove, and track their tasks with ease, ensuring they stay productive and organized.

The interface is designed to be minimal yet elegant, with smooth animations and a nature-inspired background that adds a calming vibe to the user experience. Tasks can be marked as completed or deleted with a simple click, and all task-related data is managed efficiently through Redux.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list with the "Add Task" button.
- **Task Completion**: Easily mark tasks as completed, visually distinguished with styles.
- **Remove Tasks**: Users can delete tasks they no longer need, keeping the list clutter-free.
- **Real-Time UI Updates**: Redux ensures the app updates in real time without unnecessary re-renders.
- **Smooth Animations**: Transitions and animations are added to enhance the user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The application adapts to different screen sizes for a smooth mobile and desktop experience.

## Technology Stack

- **React**: Used to build the frontend of the app. React ensures fast, efficient UI rendering.
- **Redux**: For managing the application state in a scalable way. Redux helps keep the UI in sync with the state of the application.
- **CSS**: Custom styles and animations to create a smooth and visually appealing interface.
- **Vercel**: Used to deploy the app for fast and reliable hosting.

## How It Works

1. **Task Management**: Tasks are managed through the Redux store, with actions to add, complete, and remove tasks. The Redux state makes it easy to handle multiple tasks efficiently.
   
2. **Components**: The main components include:
   - `TaskInput`: Allows users to input a new task.
   - `TaskList`: Displays the list of tasks and buttons to mark as complete or remove.
   - `TaskItem`: Handles individual task rendering and user interactions.

3. **Styling and Animations**: CSS is used for styling the app, with transitions for adding tasks, completing, and removing tasks. The background image gives the app a fresh, nature-inspired look.
